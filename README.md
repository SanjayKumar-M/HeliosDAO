Title of the Project 
<br>Sustainable Development Index Based Stablecoin</br>

About 

 Sustainable development is more than simply a worldwide objective; it is essential for the health of our planet and future generations.In answer to these problems, we provide a one-of-a-kind stablecoin ecosystem that goes beyond standard financial models. Our stablecoin is not just backed by monetary assets; it is also tied to real-world sustainable behaviours like tree planting, animal feeding, and public volunteering. [2] The objective of our project is consistent with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations, with an emphasis on environmental preservation, poverty eradication, and community empowerment.
